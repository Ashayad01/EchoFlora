          <h3>Light Requirements</h3>
          <section>
            <p>
              Most houseplants thrive in bright, indirect light. Place your
              plant near a window with filtered sunlight. Avoid harsh direct
              rays, especially in the afternoon, as they can scorch leaves.
              Low-light plants like pothos and snake plants do well in shaded
              corners.
            </p>
          </section>
          <h3>Watering Tips</h3>
          <section>
            <p>
              Water when the top inch of soil feels dry. Overwatering is one of
              the most common mistakes. Always check the soil before adding more
              water. Ensure your pot has drainage holes to prevent root rot.
              Tropical plants may enjoy a light misting, too!
            </p>
          </section>
          <h3>Soil & Potting</h3>
          <section>
            <p>
              Use well-draining soil tailored to your plant’s needs. Cacti and
              succulents prefer sandy, gritty mixes, while leafy tropical plants
              do best in organic-rich potting soils. Repot every 1–2 years to
              refresh nutrients and give roots room to grow.
            </p>
          </section>
          <h3>Temperature & Humidity</h3>
          <section>
            <p>
              Keep plants in a stable, warm environment. Most houseplants prefer
              temperatures between 65–75°F (18–24°C). Avoid cold drafts and
              sudden changes. If your home is dry, especially in winter, boost
              humidity with a pebble tray or humidifier.
            </p>
          </section>
          <h3>Feeding & Fertilizing</h3>
          <section>
            <p>
              Feed monthly during the growing season (spring and summer). Use a
              balanced, water-soluble fertilizer for most plants. Cut back
              feeding in fall and winter when growth slows down. Always follow
              package instructions to avoid over-fertilizing.
